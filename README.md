Argument Parser

Argument Parser provides an API to parse the arguments supplied to a program,
hence extracting and classifying the information provided.
This utility is meant to be used in Oyster programs while parsing arguments.

ArgParser can classify arguments as data option, switches and operands.
This guide completely describes what the different types of arguments are,
how to pass arguments arguments to programs, how to use those arguments in your programs etc.
